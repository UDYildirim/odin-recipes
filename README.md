In this project I tried to make my first mock "website".After finishing the project I can say it was fun and even though it was fairly "simple" site i learned some new things.
Things i practiced or learned during this project:

1-HTML file skeleton
2-Making lists and links
3-Why return to main page is good and important lol (and obviously how to make it)
4-Basic workflow or glimpse of it.
5-Using some simple git commands
6-How to write git commit messages (I'm sure I have a lot to learn but this was good start)
