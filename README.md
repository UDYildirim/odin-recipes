In this project I tried to make my first mock "website".After finishing the project I can say it was fun and even though it was fairly "simple" site i learned some new things.
Things i practiced or learned during this project:

- HTML file skeleton
- Making lists and links
- Why return to main page is good and important lol (and obviously how to make it)
- Basic workflow or glimpse of it.
- Using some simple git commands
- How to write git commit messages (I'm sure I have a lot to learn but this was good start)
