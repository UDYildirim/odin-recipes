In this project I tried to make my first mock "website".After finishing the project I can say it was fun and even though it was fairly basic and simple site I learned some new things.
Things I practiced or learned during this project:

- HTML file basic structure
- Making lists and links
- Why return to main page is good and important lol
- Basic workflow or glimpse of it.
- Using some simple git commands
- How to write git commit messages (I'm sure I have a lot to learn but this was good start)
