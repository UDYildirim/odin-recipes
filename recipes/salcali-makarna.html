        <p>One of my favourite dishes simple yet delicious.Pasta with tomato sauce.You can make this one very quickly should you need something fast and easy.
        </p>
        <p>Important factor for its deliciousness is the tomato sauce.All it's flavour comes from the sauce so pay attention to that part.Soo how do we make it?
            well first we need some ingredients (duhh!) to make it.
        </p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        Here is the stuff you need to make this bad boy.
        <ul>
            <li>Pasta</li>
            <li>Tomato Puree*</li>
            <li>Salt</li>

        <p>*:For tomato sauce we will be using tomato puree but you can use fresh tomatoes as well it is up to you.</p>
        <p>**:If you prefer you can use another oil here and we will be mixing these two together for tastes but its not necessary.</p>
